# About
This website aims to provide **all** existing RARBG torrents for movies, TV shows, anime, software, and games, after the tragic news of the site's shutdown.
After achieving this goal, the website will open registrations, so users can upload their own torrents. However, this will be under strict moderation to prevent the flow of malware.

# Why
Because im bored
